                    Emma was very easy to work with. She was patient and knowledgeable and has great debugging and problem solving skills. 
                    Plus, she had very good ideas about how to approach the problem using creative methods. I wouldn't hesitate to use her 
                    services again and would highly recommend her to others.</th>

                    Emma is a very reliable Computer Science tutor. She is good at answering questions that I was really confused about during class.
                Moreover, she provides homework help which is super useful for completing the complicated Machine Learning assignment. She has flexible 
                schedule and is super approachable and down to earth. </td>

                    I would highly recommend Emma for improving social studies skills. Scott is very prompt in replying, flexible with scheduling, and 
                    excellent teacher. She helped me understand the subject better by reviewing before the test. This helped me to score significantly 
                    higher on my midterms.</td>
