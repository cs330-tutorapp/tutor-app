            <td>Tony is a very knowledgeable and patient tutor. I was able to learn how to use APA properly and how to cite. He was 
                extremely helpful reviewing my paper and making suggestions. He made grammatical corrections and style suggestions 
                throughout my paper. He was amazing at providing feedback and comments. Definitely recommend him and will continue to use 
                his services.</th>

            <td>Tony is clearly very knowledgeable when it comes to writing. He has given me the tools and confidence I needed to help me really 
                improve my writing skills.Tony is easy to talk to and is very encouraging! I was afraid of being criticized, as English is not 
                my strong suit, but this was not the case at all. I look forward to tutoring sessions as the essays have improved so much. 
                I especially appreciated how quickly Tony was able to correspond and work with me. I was able to communicate with Tony through 
                FaceTime, which I really enjoyed. I have been more than pleased with all of her help and would recommend him to anyone looking 
                for some great help from a very friendly person.</td>

            <td>Tony is a very knowledgeable and thoughtful tutor. I utilized her online sessions for thesis papers, analysis essays, and 
                compare/contrast assignments. His guidance and flexibility has eased A LOT of the stress that comes with intense and demanding 
                college courses. Quick responses, quick editing turn-around time, and college "convenient" hours. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</td>
