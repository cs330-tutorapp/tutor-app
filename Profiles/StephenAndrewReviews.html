            <td>Stephen is a very knowledgeable and patient tutor. I was able to learn how to apply the biology concepts I learned in class.
                 He was extremely helpful reviewing my answers for problem sets.</td>

            <td>Stephen has been great - very informative, sends me great links to websites with other information. He has more knowledge 
                than the average tutor. He goes above and beyond a regular tutoring session. He is willing to answer all questions I have for him.</td>

            <td>Stephen was very great to work with - he was punctual, reliable, and knew his material very well. He helped me not only 
                prepare for the individual exams but also develop study habits for the future. Overall, he was a joy to work with and I would 
                definitely recommend him.</td>

            <td>Stephen was very determined to each teach me the material. We went over several details about my quiz and homework I have along way 
                to go as far as learning but I am confident she will help me to succeed in the class she was kind and generous trying to make 
                sure I understood some terms I really appreciate his help and hopefully I can continue my classes with him so I can pass this class.</td>

            <td>I needed help learning about some of Biology concepts and Stephen was very helpful. I had three sessions with him over several 
                days for a kind of biology crash course. When questions came up that he wasn't sure of he took the time to research them and got 
                back to me with solid answers. He was very professional and helpful. I definitely recommend him.</td>
