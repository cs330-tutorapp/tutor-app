# Final Prototype

## Problem & Related Work (P1)

**Problem & Motivation:** 

The domain that our project is aiming to tackle is education - specifically college students. A common problem that college students face is that they can’t keep up in their classes. Not only are they expected to keep up with the material and sometimes teach themselves, but in addition, there are little available sources for one-on-one time to learn. Of course office hours are something that all students should utilize before considering other options, but sometimes office hours are not personalized enough and can be intimidating to students. In addition, because college classes move so fast, especially here at Northwestern, it is hard for students that are just introduced to the material to be able to grasp main concepts that they have never been taught before. Therefore, our goal for this app would be for students to be able to easily find tutoring around campus from other students that have taken those classes before. In addition, this would allow students who are looking to tutor or make some extra money, the ability to do so. 

**Related Work:** 

Currently, there are no apps that fulfill this need. Right now, the biggest thing that contributes to helping students is office hours, drop-in tutoring, and peer guided study sessions. They are all great ways to be able to ensure that your homework is correct and that you are learning the correct material. However, each area lacks in ways that our app can help with. Like we mentioned above, sometimes office hours are not personalized enough to the student and can be intimidating to students. To add on, office hours are at either the professor or TA’s convenience and can be hard for students to adjust schedules in order to attend. While peer-guided tutoring does offer good foundations for explaining bigger concepts, they aren’t offered for the more advanced courses. Drop-in tutoring also has that same problem. For our app, since it is one-on-one, the tutee has the power to bring what they want to work on, whether it be more help on a concept or specific homework problems. In addition, the tutor session would be one that works for both you and your tutor, benefitting the tutor as well. Also, ideally it would have enough students that use it to offer help in those higher-level courses that are not available to have peer-guided sessions or drop-in tutoring. 

## User Research (P2 & P3)

**What we wanted to learn interviews and observations:**

Mainly, we wanted to ask them what they thought of the current tutoring system and the pros and cons of that in order to know what we could potentially implement in our platform to better suit their needs. Additionally, we also wanted to know if they would be interested in using an app and wanted to understand which features would be good for our app to have. 

**Your research approach:**

We thought that interviews would work better with what we would like to know about the potential users, as interviews give us the opportunity to ask specific questions about the platform and get their insights. In addition, we had a set of questions for interviews, but also were able to ask additional questions based on the feedback that we got. Below is the set of questions:

- How do you find tutors currently?
- What are the disadvantages of your current way of finding tutors?
- Will you be willing to accept/offer virtual tutoring sessions?
- How far are you willing to travel for tutoring (e.g. in miles)?
- How much are you willing to pay for tutoring?
- What qualifications should a tutor have?
- What subjects do you need tutoring and are they available at Northwestern right now?
- What else would you like to be incorporated in this tutoring platform?
- What obstacles have not been addressed by existing tutoring services offered online?
- What constraints do you have in your daily life that might shape your user experience?

**What we learned from your interviews and observations:**

***User needs & goals (i.e. tasks):***

After interviewing our target audiences, the main need for our tutoring app is tutors who have taken the class before, even perhaps with the same professor, and done well. In all of the interviews, the interviewees expressed interest in these types of tutors, rather than just general tutors that would help with skills because they felt that it would be most helpful with their current classes and most worthwhile their time and money. Another aspect that the interviewees mentioned was scheduling. The app design would need to be accurate in finding and updating availability for tutors, since many students are extremely busy and might only have 1 or 2 time slots in the week to meet with a tutor. Because many of classes are formatted differently, it would be difficult for a random tutor that hadn’t taken the class to understand and know what was going on, and then go and teach someone else. In addition, as students, we all have time constraints to our schedule. This is why our app would be helpful because we would be able to schedule sessions around our own schedules. In addition, some obstacles that prevent students from seeking out tutoring are the current resources available on campus, mentioned before. These services are free for students to use. So, in order to compete with this, we would really need to keep costs low, and tutoring would need to be extremely accessible for students across campus. In addition, for some higher level classes, students expressed that it might be hard to even find tutors, and instead would like more of a study group aspect. So, this could be an aspect incorporated into our app that coordinates study groups for students in the same class. This might be more advantageous for some of the higher level courses that don’t have as many students on campus that have taken them, or even for more writing based classes so that they can peer edit their papers and/or projects. 

***Various users (i.e. personas):***

The different users we envision for our app are students who are looking for a tutor, students who want to work as a tutor, and possibly parents who want to browse the web. 

## Paper Prototyping (P4)

![Paper Prototype Testing](link-to-image)
Generally, our users did not seem to have many problems with the tasks that were given to them. Most of the tasks were intuitive and simple. The users had little to know questions on how it worked. After the testing, the user pointed out a couple concept and usability problems. Our users did not feel that the in the bottom bar of the mobile paper prototype was integrated in the use of the app. The way we resolved this was by removing a couple of the features that were on the bar like search and group. Additionally, since our paper prototype was a mobile version, the web version had the bar be at the top of the screen which in later tests seemed more intuitive to use, which worked for later testing. Another issue the users brought up was that the calendar was not as intuitive as we thought. We fixed this by having the available days a highlighted color which makes it clear what days are free. The last thing the users said could be incorporated was the location to rate the tutor. We incorporated this under the profile of the tutor. 

## High-Fidelity Prototyping (P5, P6, & P7)

***A description of the tasks you decided to support. This should include screenshots of your app, with an explanation of how the various app features were intended to support the task.***

*First Task:*

Our user searches for a tutor listed on the website by the tutor’s name or the courses he/she offers. 

![Website Home Page](https://github.com/cs330-tutorapp/tutor-app/blob/project_8/Readme/Website%20Page.png)

The home page of our app has a table that contains the tutors’ information including their name, courses they offer, reviews, and ratings. The search bar on top of the home page allows users to perform the searches. The search bar allows users to get the information they want faster. 

Another component of the task is sorting the tutors listed on the website by ratings. This could be done by clicking the Ratings button. 

![Sort Tutors By Ratings](https://github.com/cs330-tutorapp/tutor-app/blob/project_8/Readme/Sort%20Tutors.png)

*Second Task:*

The second task is to allow the user to log into his/her account to view his/her own profile and the tutor’s profile. The user could log in when he/she opens the website by clicking on the Log In button on the navigation bar. 

![Log In Page](https://github.com/cs330-tutorapp/tutor-app/blob/project_8/Readme/Log%20In%20Page.png)

After the user fills in the credentials and clicks on the green bar that says Login, the user will be taken to the Profile page, which contains information about the user. After the user is logged in, the user could choose to Log Out by clicking the button on the navigation bar.


![Profile Page](https://github.com/cs330-tutorapp/tutor-app/blob/project_8/Readme/Profile%20Page.png)

![Tutor Profile Page](https://github.com/cs330-tutorapp/tutor-app/blob/project_8/Readme/Tutor%20Profile.png)

On the home page, the user could view the tutor’s profile and see their availability and full reviews.

*Third Task:*

The third task is a chat page and the chat function. The chat page allows users to search all the chats and keeps track of time. Clicking on each contact will bring you to a chat with that specific tutor.

![Chat Page](https://github.com/cs330-tutorapp/tutor-app/blob/project_8/Readme/Chat%20Page.png)

The chatting function allows the students to talk to the tutor about class experience, availability, and where they could meet up. In addition, they would be able to decide which tutor they want to go with and which one they feel would be a best fit.

![Send Message](https://github.com/cs330-tutorapp/tutor-app/blob/project_8/Readme/Send%20Message.png)

***A description of your three components you chose to implement:***

*Interactive Data Filter:*

The Interactive Data Filter we implemented is able to filter the name of tutors or the courses the tutor if offering, as well as filtering the data by the ratings of tutors. 

*Users Profile:*

We created profiles for the user as well as profiles of the listed tutors on the website. After the user is logged in, the user is able to edit his or her own profile, as well as looking at tutors’ profiles. The user’s profile includes name, contact information, school, major, year of school, and a profile picture. The tutors’ profiles include name, limited contact information, school, major, year of school, profile pictures, courses they are offering, past reviews of them from other users, as well as an availability calendar. 

*Social Interactions:*

We implemented a chat page and function. The chat page shows your chat messages displayed in chronological order. There is an option to click on and chat with a tutor, which will bring you to a chat page with that tutor and you are able to send messages on enter or the send button. In this way, the users could interact with each other without exchanging detailed contact information to protect their privacy. 


## Reflection

***Accomplishments:***

We managed to implement the essential functionalities we wanted in our app, including the search function, the profile page for both the student and tutor, the chat function, login, logout and sign up function. These functions allow Northwestern students and tutors to connect through our app and find a time that works for both of them. Specifically, our home page included a search bar and ratings for the tutors, where they are able to see the tutors ranked based on their rating. Students can view tutors’ profiles by clicking on their names on the home page as well as view or edit their own profiles. Students are also able to chat with tutors via the “Chat with xxx” on the home page or through “Chat” on the navigation bar. The website allows students to find, read about and contact the tutors they want and allows tutors to connect with the students. 

***Next Steps:***

Since the website is just an initial version of our vision, there exists more functions that we want to incorporate but could not in the time frame given to us. One of those functions is a group study option. This idea was tossed around since the beginning because it was one of the things that users wanted from an application like ours. Ideally, functions like group study will go under the More page, which is currently empty. Additionally, in the More page, users can customize the website and control settings in this page. Another function we would have added if we had more time is the calendar booking system. It would allow the user to click on the available day and see what times are available. From there they would be able to select times and then have a booking submission pop up to fill out. A final function that a future prototype would have is the ability to add reviews as a user. Currently, a user can see past reviews; however, there is no button or anything implemented to add a review. The place to add a review would be implemented in the tutor profile or a notification after a tutoring session is over.
