## Problem & Related Work (P1)
**Problem & Motivation:** The domain that our project is aiming to tackle is education - specifically college students. A common problem that college students face is that they can’t keep up in their classes. Not only are they expected to keep up with the material and sometimes teach themselves, but in addition, there are little available sources for one-on-one time to learn. Of course office hours are something that all students should utilize before considering other options, but sometimes office hours are not personalized enough and can be intimidating to students. In addition, because college classes move so fast, especially here at Northwestern, it is hard for students that are just introduced to the material to be able to grasp main concepts that they have never been taught before. Therefore, our goal for this app would be for students to be able to easily find tutoring around campus from other students that have taken those classes before. In addition, this would allow students who are looking to tutor or make some extra money, the ability to do so. 

**Related Work:** Currently, there are no apps that fulfill this need. Right now, the biggest thing that contributes to helping students is office hours, drop-in tutoring, and peer guided study sessions. They are all great ways to be able to ensure that your homework is correct and that you are learning the correct material. However, each area lacks in ways that our app can help with. Like we mentioned above, sometimes office hours are not personalized enough to the student and can be intimidating to students. To add on, office hours are at either the professor or TA’s convenience and can be hard for students to adjust schedules in order to attend. While peer-guided tutoring does offer good foundations for explaining bigger concepts, they aren’t offered for the more advanced courses. Drop-in tutoring also has that same problem. For our app, since it is one-on-one, the tutee has the power to bring what they want to work on, whether it be more help on a concept or specific homework problems. In addition, the tutor session would be one that works for both you and your tutor, benefitting the tutor as well. Also, ideally it would have enough students that use it to offer help in those higher-level courses that are not available to have peer-guided sessions or drop-in tutoring.
