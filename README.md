## Problem & Related Work (P1)

**Problem & Motivation:** The domain that our project is aiming to tackle is education - specifically college students. A common problem that college students face is that they can’t keep up in their classes. Not only are they expected to keep up with the material and sometimes teach themselves, but in addition, there are little available sources for one-on-one time to learn. Of course office hours are something that all students should utilize before considering other options, but sometimes office hours are not personalized enough and can be intimidating to students. In addition, because college classes move so fast, especially here at Northwestern, it is hard for students that are just introduced to the material to be able to grasp main concepts that they have never been taught before. Therefore, our goal for this app would be for students to be able to easily find tutoring around campus from other students that have taken those classes before. In addition, this would allow students who are looking to tutor or make some extra money, the ability to do so. 

**Related Work:** Currently, there are no apps that fulfill this need. Right now, the biggest thing that contributes to helping students is office hours, drop-in tutoring, and peer guided study sessions. They are all great ways to be able to ensure that your homework is correct and that you are learning the correct material. However, each area lacks in ways that our app can help with. Like we mentioned above, sometimes office hours are not personalized enough to the student and can be intimidating to students. To add on, office hours are at either the professor or TA’s convenience and can be hard for students to adjust schedules in order to attend. While peer-guided tutoring does offer good foundations for explaining bigger concepts, they aren’t offered for the more advanced courses. Drop-in tutoring also has that same problem. For our app, since it is one-on-one, the tutee has the power to bring what they want to work on, whether it be more help on a concept or specific homework problems. In addition, the tutor session would be one that works for both you and your tutor, benefitting the tutor as well. Also, ideally it would have enough students that use it to offer help in those higher-level courses that are not available to have peer-guided sessions or drop-in tutoring. 

## User Research (P2 & P3)

**What we wanted to learn interviews and observations:**
Mainly, we wanted to ask them what they thought of the current tutoring system and the pros and cons of that in order to know what we could potentially implement in our platform to better suit their needs. Additionally, we also wanted to know if they would be interested in using an app and wanted to understand which features would be good for our app to have. 

**Your research approach:**
We thought that interviews would work better with what we would like to know about the potential users, as interviews give us the opportunity to ask specific questions about the platform and get their insights. In addition, we had a set of questions for interviews, but also were able to ask additional questions based on the feedback that we got. Below is the set of questions:

- How do you find tutors currently?
- What are the disadvantages of your current way of finding tutors?
- Will you be willing to accept/offer virtual tutoring sessions?
- How far are you willing to travel for tutoring (e.g. in miles)?
- How much are you willing to pay for tutoring?
- What qualifications should a tutor have?
- What subjects do you need tutoring and are they available at Northwestern right now?
- What else would you like to be incorporated in this tutoring platform?
- What obstacles have not been addressed by existing tutoring services offered online?
- What constraints do you have in your daily life that might shape your user experience?

**What we learned from your interviews and observations:**
*User needs & goals (i.e. tasks):*
After interviewing our target audiences, the main need for our tutoring app is tutors who have taken the class before, even perhaps with the same professor, and done well. In all of the interviews, the interviewees expressed interest in these types of tutors, rather than just general tutors that would help with skills because they felt that it would be most helpful with their current classes and most worthwhile their time and money. Another aspect that the interviewees mentioned was scheduling. The app design would need to be accurate in finding and updating availability for tutors, since many students are extremely busy and might only have 1 or 2 time slots in the week to meet with a tutor. Because many of classes are formatted differently, it would be difficult for a random tutor that hadn’t taken the class to understand and know what was going on, and then go and teach someone else. In addition, as students, we all have time constraints to our schedule. This is why our app would be helpful because we would be able to schedule sessions around our own schedules. In addition, some obstacles that prevent students from seeking out tutoring are the current resources available on campus, mentioned before. These services are free for students to use. So, in order to compete with this, we would really need to keep costs low, and tutoring would need to be extremely accessible for students across campus. In addition, for some higher level classes, students expressed that it might be hard to even find tutors, and instead would like more of a study group aspect. So, this could be an aspect incorporated into our app that coordinates study groups for students in the same class. This might be more advantageous for some of the higher level courses that don’t have as many students on campus that have taken them, or even for more writing based classes so that they can peer edit their papers and/or projects. 

*Various users (i.e. personas):*
The different users we envision for our app are students who are looking for a tutor, students who want to work as a tutor, and possibly parents who want to browse the web.
