            <td>After trying to find a tutor that specialized in Math, I came across Apple's profile. Not only is she studying to become a
                future Math professor, but she has been very down to earth and easy to communicate with through email, text, and phone. I'm 
                glad I made the right choice in picking her as my tutor because in such little time he was able to teach me a lot of calculus 
                concepts that will come in handy when I proceed with my college career. He has also been available to meet me at various 
                locations and times and that has been very helpful. Looking forward to meeting up with her again.</th>

            <td>Apple is a very attentive and friendly tutor. She takes note of the student's specific weaknesses and introduces efficient 
                methods for improving. Apple has helped our son to better understand calculus and to feel more confident as a learner. My
                 grades have improved tremendously! I would recommend Apple to someone else who needs help in Calc and wants to be confident 
                 with their mathematical skills.</td>

                Apple is an excellent tutor who was able to explain the concepts of Calculus in a way that my regular professor was not able to 
                convey. Apple always made time for us when we requested it, often on short notice. She was always prompt and spent the time 
                needed to cover the subject. I highly recommend Apple as a tutor!</td>
